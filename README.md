National Parks
==============

In this project we were challenged to build a custom web page with data that is pulled from the database and rendered to the client through the API. We were free to use any tools we wanted. The only extra requirements were to use some kind of ETL process, implement pagination, and implement a redis client or web sockets. In this repository you will find the design documents and the backend done with express api and mongodb. The api is an MVC using passport js for authentication. I used a web socket to load and paginate through images. The web page is intended to load a random US National Park at random. The data comes from querying wikipedia, and the pictures were downloaded without permission. Therefore the content is not publishable.
